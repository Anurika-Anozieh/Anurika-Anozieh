<div class="title">CATARRH</div>
<div class="about">
<div class="subtitle">ABOUT</div>
<div class="subbody">Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body.
It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face).
It's often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh.
Catarrh can be a nuisance and may be difficult to get rid of, but it's not harmful and there are treatments available.

<div class="causes">
<div class="subtitle">CAUSES</div>
<div class="subbody">Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus.
This can be triggered by:
<ul> 
<li>A cold or other infections</li>
<li>Hay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis</li>
<li>Non-allergic rhinitis</li>
<img src="catarrh2.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:500px">
<li>Nasal polyps</li>
<li>It's unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it's not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection.</li>
<li>It may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose or an increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat.</li>
</ul>

<div class="symptoms">
<div class="subtitle">SYMPTOMS</div>
<div class="subbody">
<div> Catarrh can lead to a:
<ul>
<li>Constant need to clear your throat</li>
<li>Feeling that your throat is blocked</li>
<li>Blocked or stuffy nose that you can't clear</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<img src="catarrh1.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:500px">
<li>Feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat</li>
<li>Persistent cough</li>
<li>Headache or facial pain</li>
<li>Reduced sense of smell and taste</li>
<li>Crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss</li>
</ul>
These problems can be frustrating to live with and may affect your sleep, making you feel tired.
</div>
 
<div class="prevention">
<div class="subtitle">PREVENTION</div>
<div class="subbody">
      
<div> Catarrh can be prevented in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>Avoid anything that triggers symptoms. Catarrh, especially when caused by allergies, may be triggered by environmental hazards. Try to minimize your exposure to anything that tends to trigger outbursts.</li>
<li>If you have any allergens you know of, such as pollen, minimize your exposure to them throughout the day.</li>
<li>Smoky places tend to trigger catarrh, so stay away from areas prone to smoke.</li>
<li>Avoid air conditioning and heaters. Air conditioners and heaters tend to dry out air. This can make catarrh worse or trigger it again after it passes. Try to stay away from such environments.</li>
<li>If you work in an office that uses an air conditioner or heater, request to sit away from the unit to avoid triggering catarrh.</li>
<li>Humidify the air in your home. Dry air can make you more prone to catarrh. Buy a humidifier to moisten the air in your home. This can help prevent you from developing catarrh again.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      
<div class="treatment">
<div class="subtitle">TREATMENT</div>
<div class="subbody"> 

<div>
Most catarrh cases require no specific treatment. But if it does not clear up on its own, treatment then depends on the underlying cause. Try the following:

<p><b>• Decongestant Medicines</b></p>

These can help relieve a blocked nose by reducing swelling of the blood vessels in your nose. These are available from pharmacies without a prescription but should not be used for more than a few days before seeking advice as they can occasionally make the congestion worse if used for too long.

Decongestants do not usually cause side-effects and, if they do, they are likely to be mild, but may include irritation to the lining of the nose, nausea and headaches.
<p><b>• Steam Inhalation</b></p>
Steam inhalation treatment may also help. This involves inhaling steam from a bowl of hot (but not boiling) water and can help to soften and loosen any mucus in the nasal cavities.
Some people find that adding menthol crystals or eucalyptus oil to the water also helps. Steam inhalation is not recommended as a suitable treatment for children due to the risk of scalding.

<P>• Talking to a pharmacist about suitable over-the-counter medications – including decongestants, antihistamines or steroid nasal sprays.</P>
<p>There are also several remedies, such as herbal medicines, available from health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh. Some people find these helpful, but there's generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work.</p>

<h3 align="center">When To See Your Doctor</h3>
<img src="catarrh4.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:500px">
<ol>
<li>Speak to your Doctor if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with.</li>
<li>They may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as nasal polyps or allergies. This may mean you need to be referred to a specialist for tests.</li>
<li>If you're diagnosed with a specific underlying condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery.</li>
<li>If a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended. Unfortunately, however, chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time.</li>
