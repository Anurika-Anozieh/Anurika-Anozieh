<div class="subbody">Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a bacterial infection characterized by muscle spasms. In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body. Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes and spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks.[1] Spasms may be severe enough to cause bone fractures.[6] Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate. Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection. Recovery may take months. About ten percent of cases prove fatal.

<div class="subtitle">CAUSES</div>
<img src="tetanus1.jpg" style="width: 600px; height:600px">
<div class="subbody">Tetanus is caused by a toxin made by spores of bacteria, Clostridium tetani, found in soil, dust and animal feces. When the spores enter a deep flesh wound, they grow into bacteria that can produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin. The toxin impairs the nerves that control your muscles (motor neurons). The toxin can cause muscle stiffness and spasms — the major signs and symptoms of tetanus.
<p>Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or in adults who haven't kept up with their 10-year booster shots. You can't catch tetanus from a person who has it.</p>

<h2 align="center">RISK FACTORS</h2>
<b>The following increase your likelihood of getting tetanus:</b> 
</br></br>
<ul>
<li>Failure to get vaccinated or to keep up to date with booster shots against tetanus</li>
<li>An injury that lets tetanus spores into the wound</li>
<li>A foreign body, such as a nail or splinter</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Tetanus cases have developed from the following:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Puncture wounds — including from splinters, body piercings, tattoos and injection drugs</li>
<li>Gunshot wounds</li>
<li>Compound fractures</li>
<li>Burns</li>
<li>Surgical wounds</li>
<li>Injection drug use</li>
<li>Animal or insect bites</li>
<li>Infected foot ulcers</li>
<li>Dental infections</li>
<li>Infected umbilical stumps in newborns born of inadequately vaccinated mothers</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">COMPLICATIONS</h2>
Once tetanus toxin has bonded to your nerve endings it is impossible to remove. Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months.
<p><b>Complications of tetanus infection may include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Broken bones:</b> The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break.</li>
<li><b>Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism):</b> A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches.</li>
<li><b>Death:</b> Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death. Pneumonia is another cause of death.</li>
</ul>

<div class="symptoms">
<div class="subtitle">SYMPTOMS</div>
<div class="subbody">Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after tetanus bacteria enter your body through a wound. The average incubation period is seven to 10 days.
    
<p><b>Common signs and symptoms of tetanus include:</b></p>
<ul>   
<li>Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles (trismus)</li>
<li>Stiffness of your neck muscles</li>
<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
<li>Stiffness of your abdominal muscles</li>
<li>Painful body spasms lasting for several minutes, typically triggered by minor occurrences, such as a draft, loud noise, physical touch or light</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Possible other signs and symptoms include:</b></p>
<ul>   
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Elevated blood pressure</li>
<li>Rapid heart rate</li>
</ul> 

<p><b>When to see a doctor</b></p>
See your doctor for a tetanus booster shot if you haven't had a booster shot within the past 10 years, or you have a deep or dirty wound and you haven't had a booster shot in five years. If you aren't sure of when you received your last booster, get a booster.

<div class="diagnosis">
<div class="subtitle">DIAGNOSIS</div>
<div class="subbody">Doctors diagnose tetanus based on a physical exam, medical and immunization history, and the signs and symptoms of muscle spasms, stiffness and pain. Laboratory tests generally aren't helpful for diagnosing tetanus.
    

<div class="treatment">
<div class="subtitle">TREATMENT</div>
<div class="subbody">There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment consists of wound care, medications to ease symptoms and supportive care.
        
<p><b>Wound care</b></p>
It's essential to clean the wound to prevent the growth of tetanus spores. This involves removing dirt, foreign objects and dead tissue from the wound.
        
<p><b>Medications</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Antitoxin:</b> Your doctor may give you a tetanus antitoxin, such as tetanus immune globulin. However, the antitoxin can neutralize only toxin that hasn't yet bonded to nerve tissue.</li>
<li><b>Antibiotics:</b> Your doctor may also give you antibiotics, either orally or by injection, to fight tetanus bacteria.</li>
<li><b>Vaccine:</b> All people with tetanus should receive the tetanus vaccine as soon as they're diagnosed with the condition.</li>
<li><b>Sedatives:</b> Doctors generally use powerful sedatives to control muscle spasms.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other drugs:</b> Other medications, such as magnesium sulfate and certain beta blockers, might be used to regulate involuntary muscle activity, such as your heartbeat and breathing. Morphine might be used for this purpose as well as sedation.</p>

<b>Supportive therapies</b></br>

If you have a severe tetanus infection, you'll often need to stay in an intensive care setting. Since sedatives can inhibit breathing, you might temporarily need a ventilator.</p>

In order to survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper nutrition are required. An intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150 g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), or through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition). This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals.
