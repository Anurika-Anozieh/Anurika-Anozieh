<div class="about">
<div class="subtitle">ABOUT</div>
<div class="subbody">Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness.

The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems.
    
Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an "asthma attack", although doctors sometimes use the term "exacerbation".
    
Severe attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.


</div>
<div class="causes">
<div class="subtitle">CAUSES</div>
<div class="subbody">Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal.

When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs – known as a trigger – your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).
  
<h3>Common asthma triggers include:</h3>
<oi>
<li>House Dust Mites</li>
<li>Animal Fur</li>
<li>Pollen</li>
<li>Cigarette Smoke</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Viral Infections</li>
</oi>
Asthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.
  
The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition.
  
Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and elderly people.

<div class="symptoms">
<div class="subtitle">SYMPTOMS</div>

<div> 
The most common signs of asthma are:
<oi>
<li>Coughing, especially at night, during exercise or when laughing</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Chest tightness</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound in your chest when breathing, especially when exhaling)</li>
</oi> 
Any asthma symptom is serious and can become deadly if left untreated. If you’re experiencing one or more of these symptoms, visit an allergist for a diagnosis — and then develop an asthma action plan.

<div class="subtitle">PREVENTION</div>
<div class="subbody">
If you have asthma, you need to do what you can to cut your exposure to asthma triggers. Asthma triggers can aggravate your symptoms -- coughing, wheezing, and having a hard time catching your breath. While there’s no cure, there are steps you can take to keep your asthma in control and prevent an attack.
<ol>
<li><b>Identify Asthma Triggers:</b> Certain asthma triggers can set off a cascade of asthma symptoms. These include:
<ul>
<li>Air pollution</li>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Cold air</li>
<li>A cold or flu virus</li>
<li>Sinusitis</li>
<li>Smoke</li>
<li>Fragrances</li>
</ul> 
It’s vital to learn to identify your asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them.
Keep track of your symptoms in an asthma diary for several weeks. Detail all the environmental and emotional things that affect your asthma. When you have an asthma attack, check the diary to see which thing, or combination of things, might have led to it. Some common asthma triggers, like molds and cockroaches, aren’t always obvious. Ask your asthma specialist about tests to find the allergens you respond to. Then take steps to avoid them.
If you have exercise-induced asthma, are planning a heavy workout, or plan to exercise in cold, humid, or dry air, take steps to prevent an asthma attack. Follow your doctor's advice on asthma treatment (usually by using an asthma inhaler containing the drug albuterol).
<li><b>Stay Away From Allergens:</b> If you have allergies and asthma, it’s important to keep your distance from allergens (things you’re allergic to). Allergen exposure can increase the inflammation in your airways for a while, making an attack more likely.</li>
<li><b>Avoid Smoke of Any Type:</b> Smoke and asthma are a bad mix. Limit exposure to all sources of smoke, including tobacco, incense, candles, fires, and fireworks. Don’t allow smoking in your home or car, and avoid public places that permit it. If you smoke cigarettes, get help to quit. Smoking always makes asthma worse.</li>
<li><b>Prevent Colds:</b> Do what you can to stay well. Avoid close contact with people who have a cold or the flu, because catching it will make your asthma symptoms worse. Wash your hands well if you handle items that someone with a respiratory infection may have touched.</li>
<li><b>Allergy-Proof Your Home:</b> Whether you’re at home, work, or traveling, there are things you can do to allergy-proof your environment and lower your chances of an asthma attack. Don’t eat in restaurants that are smoky or allow cigarette smoking. Reserve a smoke-free hotel room. If you can, bring your own bedding and pillows in case the hotel only supplies feather pillows and down comforters. They can house dust mites and cause asthma symptoms.</li>
<li><b>Get Your Vaccinations:</b> Get a flu shot every year to protect against the flu virus, which can worsen your asthma for days or weeks. Asthma makes you more likely to have complications from the flu, like pneumonia, and to be hospitalized because of it. Anyone over 19 should get a pneumonia shot (called Pneumovax) once every 5 to 10 years. You also have a higher chance of getting pneumococcal pneumonia, a common type of bacterial pneumonia. And you need a Tdap vaccine to protect you against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, along with a zoster vaccine to keep you safe from shingles.</li>
<li><b>Consider Immunotherapy Allergy Shots:</b> If your doctor finds that you have allergies, allergy shots (immunotherapy) may help prevent allergy symptoms and keep your asthma from getting worse. With allergy shots, the doctor injects small doses of allergens under your skin on a regular schedule. Over time, your body may get used to the allergen and respond less when you’re exposed. This can help keep your asthma under control.</li>
<li><b>Take Asthma Medications as Prescribed:</b> Long-term asthma medications are designed to prevent symptoms and attacks. You need to take them every day, even if you don’t have symptoms. They’ll ease inflammation in your airways and keep your asthma under control, so it’s less likely to flare up. If side effects bother you, talk to your doctor about switching to another treatment.</li>
<li><b>Follow Your Asthma Action Plan:</b> Take your meds, even when you feel OK. If you notice symptoms, check your plan for instructions on what medications to take. During an attack, the plan can tell you what meds will help and when it’s time to call the doctor.</li>
<li><b>Use a Home Peak Flow Meter:</b> The meter shows how well air is moving through your lungs. During an attack, your airways narrow. The meter can let you know this is happening hours or days before you have any symptoms. This gives you time to take the medications listed in your treatment plan and possibly stop the attack before it starts.</li>

<div class="subtitle">TREATMENT</div>
<div class="subbody"> 

<div>
While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition.
Treatment is based on two important goals, which are:
<img src="asthma1.jpg" style="width: 450px; height:450px">
<ol>
<li>Relieving symptoms </li>
<li>Preventing future symptoms and attacks</li>
</ol>
For most people, this will involve the occasional – or, more commonly, daily – use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important.
<p>You should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so.</p>

<h3 align="center">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</h3>
Immediate intervention may be necessary, because continuing and progressive dyspnea leads to increased anxiety, aggravating the situation.
<img src="asthma2.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:500px">
<h3 align="center">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Short-acting beta2 –adrenergic agonists:</b> These are the medications of choice for relief of acute symptoms and prevention of exercise-induced asthma.</li>
<li><b>Anticholinergics:</b> Anticholinergics inhibit muscarinic cholinergic receptors and reduce intrinsic vagal tone of the airway.</li>
<li><b>Corticosteroids:</b> Corticosteroids are most effective in alleviating symptoms, improving airway function, and decreasing peak flow variability.</li>
<li><b>Leukotriene modifiers:</b> Anti Leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors that also dilate blood vessels and alter permeability.</li>
<li><b>Immunomodulators:</b> Prevent binding of IgE to the high affinity receptors of basophils and mast cells.</li>
</ol>
<h3 align="center">PEAK FLOW MONITORING</h3>
<img src="asthma4.jpg" style="width: 450px; height:450px">
<p>Peak Flow Meters: Peak flow meters measure the highest airflow during a forced expiration.</p>
<b>Daily peak flow monitoring:</b>This is recommended for patients who meet one or more of the following criteria: have moderate or severe persistent asthma, have poor perception of changes in airflow or worsening symptoms, have unexplained response to environmental or occupational exposures, or at the discretion of the clinician or patient.
<p><b>Function:</b> If peak flow monitoring is used, it helps measure asthma severity and, when added to symptom monitoring, indicates the current degree of asthma control.
