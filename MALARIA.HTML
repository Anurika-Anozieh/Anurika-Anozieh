<div class="subbody">Malaria is disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, transmitted by the bite of a infected mosquitoes. 
<img src="malaria1.jpg" style="width: 550px; height:550px">      
<p>There are many different types of plasmodium parasite, but only five types cause malaria in humans.
</br>    

These are:
    <ol>
    <li><b>Plasmodium Falciparum – </b> mainly found in Africa, it's the most common type of malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide.</li>
    <li><b>Plasmodium Vivax –</b> mainly found in Asia and South America, this parasite causes milder symptoms than Plasmodium falciparum, but it can stay in the liver for up to three years, which can result in relapses.</li>
    <li><b>Plasmodium Ovale –</b> fairly uncommon and usually found in West Africa, it can remain in your liver for several years without producing symptoms.</li>
    <li><b>Plasmodium Malariae –</b> this is quite rare and usually only found in Africa</li>
    <li><b>Plasmodium Knowlesi –</b> this is very rare and found in parts of southeast Asia</li>

<div class="prevention">
<div class="subtitle">PREVENTION</div>
<div class="subbody">There's a significant risk of getting malaria if you travel to an affected area. It's very important you take precautions to prevent the disease.
    
<p>Malaria can often be avoided using the ABCD approach to prevention, which stands for:
<ol>
<li><b>Awareness of risk –</b> find out whether you're at risk of getting malaria</li>
<li><b>Bite prevention –</b> avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellent, covering your arms and legs, and using a mosquito net.</li>
<li><b>Check whether you need to take malaria prevention tablets –</b> if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose, and finish the course.</li>
<li><b>Diagnosis –</b> seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling.</li>
</ol>
These are outlined in more detail below.

<ul>
<li><b>Being aware of the risks.</b>
</br>To check whether you need to take preventative malaria treatment for the countries you're visiting, see the Fit for Travel or National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) websites.</li>
</br>It's also important to visit your GP or local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know where you're going to be travelling.
</br>Even if you grew up in a country where malaria is common, you still need to take precautions to protect yourself from infection if you're travelling to a risk area.
</br>Nobody has complete immunity to malaria, and any level of natural protection you may have had is quickly lost when you move out of a risk area.
</br></br>
<li><b>Preventing bites:</b> </br></br>

<img src="malaria4.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:500px">

</br>It's not possible to avoid mosquito bites completely, but the less you're bitten, the less likely you are to get malaria.</li>
</br>   
<li><b>To avoid being bitten:</b>
</br>Stay somewhere that has effective air conditioning and screening on doors and windows. If this isn't possible, make sure doors and windows close properly.
</br>If you're not sleeping in an air-conditioned room, sleep under an intact mosquito net that's been treated with insecticide.
</br>Use insect repellent on your skin and in sleeping environments. Remember to reapply it frequently. The most effective repellents contain diethyltoluamide (DEET) and are available in sprays, roll-ons, sticks and creams.
</br>Wear light, loose-fitting trousers rather than shorts, and wear shirts with long sleeves. This is particularly important during early evening and at night, when mosquitoes prefer to feed.
</br>There's no evidence to suggest homeopathic remedies, electronic buzzers, vitamins B1 or B12, garlic, yeast extract spread (such as Marmite), tea tree oils or bath oils offer any protection against mosquito bites.
</br> </br>   
<li><b>Antimalarial tablets</b>
</br>There's currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria, so it's very important to take antimalarial medication to reduce your chances of getting the disease.
</br>
However, antimalarials only reduce your risk of infection by about 90%, so taking steps to avoid bites is also important.
</br></br>
<li><b>When taking antimalarial medication:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you get the right antimalarial tablets before you go – check with your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions included with your tablets carefully.</li>
<li>Depending on the type you're taking, continue to take your tablets for up to four weeks after returning from your trip to cover the incubation period of the disease.</li>
<li>Check with your Doctor to make sure you're prescribed a medication you can tolerate.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
</br>
<b><i>You may be more at risk from side effects if you:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>have HIV or AIDS</li>
<li>have epilepsy or any type of seizure condition</li>
<li>are depressed or have another mental health condition</li>
<li>have heart, liver or kidney problems</li>
<li>take medicine, such as warfarin, to prevent blood clots</li>
<li>use combined hormonal contraception, such as the contraceptive pill or contraceptive patches</li>
</ul> 
<p>If you've taken antimalarial medication in the past, don't assume it's suitable for future trips. The antimalarial you need to take depends on which strain of malaria is carried by the mosquitoes and whether they're resistant to certain types of antimalarial medication.
</br>

<p><b>Get immediate medical advice</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You must seek medical help straight away if you become ill while travelling in an area where malaria is found, or after returning from travelling, even if you've been taking antimalarial tablets.</li>  
<li>Malaria can get worse very quickly, so it's important that it's diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.</li>  
<li>If you develop symptoms of malaria while still taking antimalarial tablets, either while you're travelling or in the days and weeks after you return, remember to tell the doctor which type you have been taking. The same type of antimalarial shouldn't be used to treat you as well.</li>   
<li>If you develop symptoms after returning home, visit your GP or a hospital doctor and tell them which countries you've travelled to in the last 12 months, including any brief stopovers.</li>  
</ul> 
</ol>

<div class="diagnosis">
<div class="subtitle">DIAGNOSIS</div>
<div class="subbody">To diagnose malaria, your doctor will likely review your medical history, conduct a physical exam and order blood tests. Blood tests are the only way to confirm a malaria diagnosis. Certain blood tests can help your doctor by showing:

<li>The presence of the parasite in the blood, to confirm that you have malaria</li>
<li>Which type of malaria parasite is causing your symptoms</li>
<li>If your infection is caused by a parasite resistant to certain drugs</li>
<li>Other blood tests help determine whether the disease is causing any serious complications.</li>
      
<p>Some blood tests can take several days to complete, while others can produce results in less than 15 minutes.</p>
</div>

<div class="treatment">
<div class="subtitle">TREATMENT</div>
<div class="subbody"> Malaria is treated with prescription drugs to kill the parasite. The types of drugs and the length of treatment will vary, depending on:
<li>Which type of malaria parasite you have</li>
<li>The severity of your symptoms</li>
<li>Your age</li>
<li>Whether you're pregnant</li>

<h3 align="center">Medication</h3>
The most common antimalarial drugs include:
<p><b>Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).</b> ACTs are, in many cases, the first line treatment for malaria. There are several different types of ACTs. Examples include artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) and artesunate-amodiaquine. Each ACT is a combination of two or more drugs that work against the malaria parasite in different ways.</p>
<p><b>Chloroquine phosphate.</b> Chloroquine is the preferred treatment for any parasite that is sensitive to the drug. But in many parts of the world, the parasites that cause malaria are resistant to chloroquine, and the drug is no longer an effective treatment.</p>
<p>Other common antimalarial drugs include:</p>
    
<li>Combination of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone)</li>
<li>Quinine sulfate (Qualaquin) with doxycycline (Vibramycin, Monodox, others)</li>
<li>Mefloquine</li>
<li>Primaquine phosphate</li>
New antimalarial drugs are being researched and developed. Malaria treatment is marked by a constant struggle between evolving drug-resistant parasites and the search for new drug formulations. For example, one variety of the malaria parasite has demonstrated resistance to nearly all of the available antimalarial drugs.
    
</br></br>
If you suspect you have malaria or that you've been exposed, you're likely to start by seeing your family doctor. 
<img src="malaria2.jpg" style="width: 500px; height:500px">
</br></br>However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an infectious disease specialist. If you have severe symptoms — especially during or after travel in an area where malaria is common — seek emergency medical attention.
